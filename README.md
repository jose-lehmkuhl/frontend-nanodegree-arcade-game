#Classic Arcade Game Clone

This is my object-oriented JavaScript project from Udacity's Web Front-end Advanced Nanodegree, note that I only did the app.js file, the rest of the game files were forked from [here](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game).


## Running the game

Just run the index.html file on the desired web browser after downloading or cloning the game from [this github directory](https://github.com/jose-lehmkuhl/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game). Please, note that all files must be on their relative paths from the index.html file directory.


## How to play

Player wins the game by reaching the water at the top of the screen.

* Move around using the Up, Left, Right and Down arrow keys.
* Avoid colliding with the enemies(bugs), if you do, you will return to the starting point.
* Once the player reach the water the game will just reset him/her to the starting position.
